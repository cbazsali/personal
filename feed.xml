<description>Blogging</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello. I thought I’d set up a blog here. It was fun setting it up
withough any services like Blogger or Squarespace. However, I did use
ChatGPT quite liberally withe the python scripts needed to hook it up to
my vimwiki diary.</p>
<p>There is no comment section by design. But I do invite you to email
me with any responses you feel like making, whether you want to comment
on something I wrote, ask questions, or respectfully disagree and start
a private conversation. I’d really like to hear from you, but I’m
keeping it old school on purpose. You know…so it’s just between you and
me.</p>
