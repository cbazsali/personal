<p>Lots of Mardi Gras shows with the Cajun Strangers! Last weekend we
played for a Mardi Gras-themed party at Carthage College. Tomorrow,
we’re playing a Petskull Brewery in Manitowoc. On Tuesday itself we will
be at Full Mile Brewery in Sun Prairie and then later at Mickey’s Tavern
in Madison. See the <a

Strangers schedule</a> for details.</p>

<p>I thought I’d set up a blog here. It was fun setting it up without
any services like Blogger or Squarespace. However, I did use ChatGPT
quite liberally with the python scripts needed to hook it up to my
vimwiki diary.</p>
<p>There is no comment section, and that is by design. But I do invite
you to email me with any responses you feel like making, whether you
want to comment on something I wrote, ask questions, or respectfully
disagree and start a private conversation. I’d really like to hear from
you, but I’m keeping it old school on purpose. You know…so it’s just
between you and me.</p>
