				<h2>Greetings. Let me introduce myself.</h2>
				<p>I am Colin Bazsali, and I am a teacher and musician. I love reading, listening to vinyl and shellac, wristwatches, and fountain pens. I like to hike, use typewriters, and old-school computing. I'm good at banjo, I write mediocre poetry, and I stutter. I always have a pen in my shirt pocket and carry a pocket notebook.</p>
				<p>I think bow ties are cool. My spirit animal is Yoda, and am often spotted outdoors wearing a fedora. People tell me I look young for my age and have great hair. I love wearing sunglasses. My heroes are Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and Indiana Jones. My handwriting is atrocious, but I love sushi.</p>
				<h3>I am very concered about the effect of social media on people and society.</h3>
				<p>I like people and birds. My favorite season is summer. I love the combination of sportcoats, raw denim jeans, and leather work boots. I remember when there were no Internet or GPS and people smoked inside and used handheld CB radios. I wish I could carry around a bullwhip on my belt.</p>
				<p>I believe unconditional kindness can save us.</p> 
				<p>I love jazz. I played Henry Higgins in my high school musical years ago and still have dreams about it. I have lived in seven different cities and towns in four states, and on two continents. My favorite was Boston.</p>
				<p>I like to travel, but I haven't done it enough. I always use the Linux terminal, but I'm not a programmer. I can read Latin and Greek, but I wish I could speak Spanish. I like flowers and plants, but I hate gardening. Sometimes I wish I was a mole in the ground.</p>
				<h3>I do not follow sports. Sports never followed me.</h3>
				<p>I used to be a singing cowboy, a jazz drummer, a Methodist, an Artwork Specialist, copy editor, and a Life Scout, but now I'm not any of those things anymore.</p>
				<p>I try to live honestly, humorously, and with enough money in the meter. I am a Wisconsinite, secular humanist, and a meat eater. I love paperbacks and 45s and pocket knives. I miss public telephone booths, but I'm astounded and terrified by my iPhone.</a>
				<h3>Coffee is my sacrament.</h3>
				<p>I wish I could cook. I wish I could read faster. I wish I still had my Apple IIe. I wish my friend Bradley was still alive. I wish there were more snow days. I wish more people read books. I wish America was more like Harpo Marx.</p>
				<p>I wish you well.</p>
