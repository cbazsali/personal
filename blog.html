<p>My brother is Gordon Bazsali (gordonbazsali.com), and he is a
composer, musician, former teacher living in Busan, South Korea. He’s
pretty awesome. You should visit his website and especially his latest
project, <a href="https://www.gordonbazsali.com/365-pieces-in-2026">365
Pieces in 2026</a>, where he composes and posts a short piece of music
and accompanying video art every day.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s as good as <a

but it’s pretty great. You should check it out.</p>

<p>Lots of Mardi Gras shows with the Cajun Strangers! Last weekend we
played for a Mardi Gras-themed party at Carthage College. Tomorrow,
we’re playing a Petskull Brewery in Manitowoc. On Tuesday itself we will
be at Full Mile Brewery in Sun Prairie and then later at Mickey’s Tavern
in Madison. See the <a

Strangers schedule</a> for details.</p>

<p>I thought I’d set up a blog here. It was fun setting it up without
any services like Blogger or Squarespace. However, I did use ChatGPT
quite liberally with the python scripts needed to hook it up to my
vimwiki diary.</p>
<p>There is no comment section, and that is by design. But I do invite
you to email me with any responses you feel like making, whether you
want to comment on something I wrote, ask questions, or respectfully
disagree and start a private conversation. I’d really like to hear from
you, but I’m keeping it old school on purpose. You know…so it’s just
between you and me.</p>
