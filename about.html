				<h1>About Me and This Website</h1>
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I was born in 1973 in Elgin, Illinois, during Watergate and just after US troops left Vietnam. I was raised in Hampshire, Illinois, where I went to school, rode my bike, and dreamed of being a Jedi, then a stuntman, then a writer.</p>
				<p>I have a BA in English and Classics from the University of Iowa, where I met my wife, and an MA in Humanities from the University of Chicago.</p>
				<p>I've worked in retail, newspapers, web development, and music performance. I'm now a high school English teacher and so grateful to be one.</p>
				<p>I'm a traditional musician, playing banjo, guitar, harmonica, drums, and other folk instruments, specializing in old time and Cajun music. I'm married and have one daughter.</p>
				<h2>About this website</h2>
				<p>	I know this website is not exactly beautiful. It looks like something out of the last century.</p>
				<p>I didn't make it like this out of nostalgia. (Well, not only.) I know how to use Google Sites and Squarespace. But I also know html and css, and I want to use them. This website is hand-coded and manually updated in the old-school way because I want complete control over it. And I like the simplicity of a plain text website you can read anywhere on anything and that is not dependent an any service or platform. It's a website that says "Look! I made this! For me and for you!"</p>
				<p>The purpose of this website is to make for myself a place on the internet where people who know me or want to know me can go if they want to find out what I'm doing and how to find me. I don't use social media. I don't want to depend on a service or a platform. I don't want algorithms to mediate between me and you. Just a couple machines, a network, and a little honest, hand-written code. It's not as good as sitting with you in a bar, playing music with you, conferencing with you in my classroom, or running into you on the street. But it will have to do for now until we meet again!</p>
